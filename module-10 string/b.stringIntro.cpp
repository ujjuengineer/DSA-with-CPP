    // note that, string and array of string is 2 different things, 
    //if we do "string arr[n]" this will create array of strings which will take input of n strings, where as if we do "string str;" this create actual string

    // if you scroll your pointer to "ujjwal", it will show 7 character, this is because compiler is adding \0 at end as extra variable

    // taking input in string
    string s;

    // so we use getline(cin, string name);
